# Concatenated-Cats
Group Project 1

For our first project we created an interactive music player based off the Spotify API.

It prompts the user to log-in with their Premium Spotify Account and has the user select the Genre of music from a drop down menu.

Selecting the genre makes the page active and starts to play music. The music is generated at Random by spotify allowing the user to get a taste of different artists and bands.

As the moment, the core functionaily of the player is a single button to play or pause the track currently playing, and two additional buttons to move back to the previous song or to the next song. 

Next to the three core plackback buttons is a small black box displaying the current band and song playing.

In the center of the page will display the Album art for the music.

To the left of the Album art is a lyric box that will contain lyrics for the current Song playing provided the lyrics are available. 

The lyrics we obtained from the OVH API which is a sperate API from Spotify. 

To the right of the album art is box containing the songs you've already listened to and it displays what song will be next in line. The current song being played has a highlight over it to indicate that. 

Now the application as you currently see has some open room to it.....in other words, it has room to evolve.

Additional funcationaly such as an in-browser volume slider, a seek bar, an artist/song search bar, and/or an eqaualizer could be developed down the line based on user needs and usage. 

To quote the late and great Steve Jobs, "Simple can be harder then complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But its worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."

So to that, our focuse was a simple site that just worked simply so. It may never move Mount Everest, but watch out Kilimanjaro.
